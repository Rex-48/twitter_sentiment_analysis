# Tweet Sentiment Analysis Web App

This is a Flask-based web application for sentiment analysis of tweets and text. The application uses the Twitter API to fetch tweets based on a search query and performs sentiment analysis on those tweets. It also allows users to perform sentiment analysis on their own input text.

## Features

1. **Phrase-Level Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Allows users to enter a search query (e.g., hashtag, keyword) and fetch recent tweets.
   - The sentiment of each tweet is analyzed and categorized as "positive", "negative", or "neutral".

2. **Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Allows users to input custom text, which is then analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building the web application.
- **Tweepy**: A Python library for interacting with the Twitter API to fetch tweets.
- **TextBlob**: A Python library for processing textual data and performing sentiment analysis.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the front-end interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have Python 3 and `pip` installed. You also need to install the following Python libraries:

1. `Flask`
2. `tweepy`
3. `textblob`

### Steps to Install

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tweet-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd tweet-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your **Twitter API keys**:
   - Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) and create an application to obtain your API keys.
   - Replace the placeholders for `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret` in the code with your own Twitter API credentials.

5. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## Usage

### Phrase-Level Sentiment Analysis:
- Enter a search query (e.g., a hashtag or keyword) in the input box.
- Specify how many tweets to fetch.
- The application will display a list of tweets along with their sentiment classification.

### Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis:
- Enter a custom sentence or text in the input box.
- The application will classify the sentiment as "positive", "negative", or "neutral".

## Example of Response Format

- **Input (Tweet/Custom Text)**: `"I love this new feature!"`
- **Output**: `"Sentiment: Positive"`
